# Metamodel development in data catalogue using immunisation report dataset
Repository for designed metamodel for data catalogue, including designs and examples

## Abstract
This thesis explores the development of a metamodel for a data catalogue to improve healthcare data management and sharing in Estonia, aligned with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulations. The research evaluates the healthDCAT-AP standard as a potential framework for metadata management, focusing on its ability to meet diverse user needs, including those of researchers, policymakers, data managers, and software developers.
Employing a design science research methodology and Zachman’s framework, the study progressed through iterative cycles to design, test, and evaluate the metamodel. Using the immunisation report dataset as a case study, the healthDCAT-AP standard was assessed for its capacity to describe metadata comprehensively and facilitate data reusability. 
This thesis is written in English and is 61 pages long, including 6 chapters, 7 figures and 1 table. All the sources used to write the research have been cited and 54 sources were used. The Google Scholar search engine was used to search for sources. While the standard successfully supported general metadata descriptions and FAIR principles, it was found insufficient for detailed attribute-level descriptions and ensuring semantic consistency.
The thesis highlights the importance of integrating multiple standards, supporting attribute-level metadata, and ensuring interoperability across systems. Ultimately, this thesis underscores the pivotal role of metadata in promoting data-driven decision-making and innovation in healthcare. Despite unresolved challenges, the work offers a clear strategic direction for advancing metadata management practices and achieving the vision of the European Health Data Space. 

## Designed and developed artifacts
Designed and developed artifacts that are place in this repository: 

1. Process model, adapted metadata management process - indicates how metadata management adds or receives added value from each subprocess, indicated in the model.
2. Proposed conceptual metamodel to data catalogue - taken into consideration use cases, context and process model, therefore designed metamodel that takes into consideration the points or processes, where metadata emerges and each process affects the next.
3. Simplified architecture model - designed on the basis of the data management body of knowledge, thus providing additional requirements to the data catalogue and metamodel.
4. Simulation examples of immunisation report, used ttl language and healthDCAT-AP standard to simulate machine readable data descriptions and evaluate the conformance to requirements, gathered during master thesis iterations.
